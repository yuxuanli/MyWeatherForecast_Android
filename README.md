I independently transplanted the weather forecast service from web to android.

Building from zero using Java language within Android Studio, I got familiar with android development, such as handling usersâ€™ input, switching between activities and fragment, tuning and designing UI interface, using Facebook SDK and AERIS Map SDK, etc. 

Because of size limit, I only uploaded some core source code.
